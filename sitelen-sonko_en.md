# <span class="en">Toki Pona is not like Chinese writing</span>

> <span class="en">I gave this page in [lipu tenpo nanpa mun](https://liputenpo.org/2021/03/01/lipu-tenpo-nanpa-mun/)</span>

<span class="en">Toki Pona is a cute way of speaking. But for me Toki Pona is not only this. Toki Pona is a new way of thinking inside. Using it a person can make all knowledge simple.</span>

<span class="en">I can say this: "What is Toki Pona? Toki Pona is this." But this method is not entertaining and is not good. I want to use this method: "Toki Pona is like what? Toki Pona is like this." This method of knowledge giving is entertaining and gives knowledge well.</span>

<span class="en">At the start I want to say this: A way of speaking is like what? A way of speaking is like a way of writing. This is because of what? In a way of writing a person uses a symbol for a word. In a way of speaking a person uses a word for a thing of the human mind. A thing of the human mind is knowledge or a feeling or a wish.</span>

<span class="en">If so, Toki Pona and other ways of talking are like what writing? Other ways of talking are like Chinese writing. In Chinese writing a different symbol exists for all words. Languages other than Toki Pona are like this. Other languages have different words for all things of the human mind.</span>

<span class="en">If so, all languages are like Chinese writing, but Toki Pona is like Latin writing. Latin writing has one symbol for all sounds. When a person wants to write a word he must use a group of sound symbols. This is like Toki Pona. Toki Pona does not have different words for all things of the human mind. In Toki Pona a person must use many words to give a thing of the mind.</span>

<span class="en">Chinese writing is not bad and is a good method because of many things. But sound writing like Latin writing has a different power. Toki Pona has a different power like this. At a different time I want to talk about this.</span>
