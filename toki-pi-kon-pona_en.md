# Speech of Good Essence

{% include Jutu-kalama-sin-11.md %}

> In Kalama Sin 11 I spoke my feelings. In the area above you can listen to my speech in the moving picture. In this page you can see the writing of my speech in the moving picture. I bettered my broken speech a little.

Hello! I am the person Telakoman. I came to know Toki Pona in a big time. I started my coming to know in six or seven year times ago. I don't know well.

Toki Pona is good from my perspective because of this: I am a person of change speech. Change speech is this: I look at document number one, I write the essence of document number one in document number two using a different way of speech. This is my work. This work is very good from my perspective.

Differently, knowlege of speech is very good from my perspective. I want to come to know this: A word can give an essence if what is there? Because of what do the sounds from my mouth give my feeling to your heart? Knowledge is what? What knowledge is inside a word? A human head knows a way of speech because of what? A human head comes to know a new way of speech using what way? All these are very important knowledge wishes, from my perspective. I feel good from this knowledge hunt.

I use the Toki Pona of the book of interaction with the official Toki Pona book. This is my way of Toki Pona, but other ways are not bad from my perspective. I use the way of the book of interaction with the official Toki Pona book because of two things:

Number one, I want this: All persons know the essence of my speech. Number two, Toki Pona uses words of a small quantity. I use Toki Pona for this knowledge hunt: When a way of speech uses words of a small quantity, what exists? In the context of this knowledge wish, new words are not necessary. New words are bad for this wish. I want to use words of a small quantity for giving of knowledge! But in reality, new words are not bad from my perspective. Only this is true: In the context of my way of knowledge wishing, I do not want to use the new words.

At this time I want to talk about this to you: I made a group of moving pictures in a land of plants. Possibly you saw these moving pictures. Its name is ["toki lili lon ma kasi"](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/toki-lili-lon-ma-kasi_en), or "Little Speeches in a Land of Plants." I want to talk about this to you: I made these moving pictures because of what. I used what method in these moving pictures. You can make moving pictures like my moving pictures using what method.

## My moving pictures use what method?

You can see the group of moving pictures in the YouTube world. The name of the group is "toki lili lon ma kasi." Many small moving pictures are in this group. You can look at all these moving pictures in little time. On a time tool you will use little times of this amount: 30 or something like this. This is a short time, hah! In this short time you can see all the moving pictures of this group.  

In these moving pictures I give this looking to you: What is in the land of plants? You see big plants and big waters. I made these moving pictures in past time. In that time the colors of the plant papers were changing, were becoming yellow, were becoming red. All was good looking, hah! In the moving pictures I say all of this using Toki Pona.

The different thing of my moving pictures is this: I speak using Toki Pona, but if you do not know Toki Pona you can know the essence of my speech. This is because of what? This is because of this: I give small pictures on the face of the moving pictures. I used many small pictures, let me talk about one: When I talk about water using Toki Pona, you see a water picture on the face of the moving picture. So you do not need to know the word "telo" in Toki Pona. If you know or do not know the word "telo", you know this: I am talking about water.   

Possibly my moving pictures are very entertaining or sweet looking for you. But this is an important method of giving knowledge of a new way of speech: Speech of good essence.

## A person comes to know a way of speech using what method?

What is speech of good essence? Let me start at the start.

When a person wants to come to know a way of speech like English or Russian or Chinese or Toki Pona, a person must use what method?

In past time, for a big time, many persons used a method like this: The person looks at a book of a new way of speaking. The book gives knowledge of the way of speech. "This word is like this word of your speech. That word is like that word of your speech. When you use this word, use this word at the start, at the end use that word." The book gives this knowledge of the new way of speech to you. A person uses much time and uses much head power for this: They come to know well all the knowledge of this book.

A person can come to know a way of speech using this method, or what? Yes, but the way of this knowledge can be bad from the perspective of the need. When a person comes to know a way of speech, what do they need? They need this: They use the way of speech without using much time, without using head power. They need this: When they feel a thing they can say this in the same time.

When a person comes to know a way of speech from a book, they know. But when they need to use the way of speech they must use much time, they must use power. Inside, they say this all the time: "This word is which word? Which word must be number one? If I use a word in this way, I must change the sound in which way?" They must talk inside a lot.

In past time many knowledge persons said this: Coming to know a way of speech from a book requires much head power. But when you come to know well, in much time, you come to feel the speech. When you come to feel it you can talk without using much power, without using much time.

But another group of knowledge persons exists. One person of this group is the person Stephen Krashen. The person Krashen and knowledge persons like him say this: With ways of speech, this method of coming to know is bad. A person cannot come to feel by coming to know.

## A person comes to know a way of speech from speech of good essence

If this is a bad method of coming to know, what is a good method? The person Krashen talks about two things.

Number one is this: Coming to know and coming to feel are different. When a person comes to know a way of speech they do not feel this way of speech. A person like this can talk about many things of the way of speech. But possibly the person cannot use this way of speech. Differently, a person can come to feel a way of speech without using knowledge.

Look at your parent speech. You feel your parent speech. So you use your parent speech without using much power. But possibly you do not know the way of your speech. Possibly I say this to you: "In your parent speech this word is good, but that word is crazy. Why is that crazy word crazy?" Possibly you do not know this: The crazy word of your speech is crazy because of what. Possibly you say this. "I do not know, but I use it." Yes, you use the crazy word because of this: You feel it.

In English, coming to know is "language learning" and coming to feel is "language acquisition."

The person Krashen said two things. Number two is this: A person comes to know a new way of speech using one method: Speech of good essence.

What is speech of good essence? With speech of good essence, you know the essence well, but you do not know all the words.

If you do not know all the words, you can know the essence using what method? Possibly you do not know one word, but you know all the other words. So you can feel the essence of the unknown word.

Differently you can know the essence from unspoken things. Inside your head, see this: A person is coming to you. They are speaking to you in a different way of speech. You do not know their speech. But you see this: The air is hot. This person is feeling bad. They are opening their mouth. You can hear breath in their mouth. The long thing of their hand is going to their mouth. They want this: You look at their mouth. In their mouth there is no water. So you feel the essence of the speech of this person. The essence is this: "Give water to me." You feel the essence of the speech of this person.

This is speech of good essence. With speech of good essence you do not know all the words, but you know the essence from other words or other knowledge. The person Krashen says this: When a person hears speech of good essence the person comes to feel the way of speech. Differently, the person Krashen says this: Other methods do not exist. A person can come to know well a way of speech, but this is not coming to feel. A person comes to feel a new way of speech using only speech of good essence.

The word of speech of good essence in English is this: "Comprehensible input."

## You can make moving pictures like my moving pictures

Ah, I said many things! But I feel this: At this time you know this: I made my moving pictures because of what? I made my moving pictures for this: I want to give speech of good essence to new persons of Toki Pona.

When I make these moving pictures I say this inside: If a person looking does not know Toki Pona can they know the essence of my moving picture?

Let me say something entertaining to you: Many times I made a new moving picture. For me, this moving picture was good. But I did not give it to the YouTube world at that time. Number one, I went to the side of my woman, I said this to her: "Look at this moving picture. Did you know the essence or what?" I did this many times. I feel a little humble toward my woman. I do not want this: My woman feels bad because of this: All the time her man is giving crazy moving pictures to her! She loves me very much hah, each time she looked at the moving picture.

Many times when I gave a new moving picture to my woman, my woman looked and said this to me: "I did not know the essence of one thing or a different thing." I felt a little bad, but I changed a little the moving picture. I gave a new moving picture, or I changed the picture on the face of the moving picture. At the end I gave afresh the moving picture to my woman. If the essence was good for my woman I gave it to the YouTube world.

## End speech

I want to say this to you, at the end I say this: You can make moving pictures like my moving pictures. This is needed for new persons of Toki Pona. The important thing is this: If a person does not know Toki Pona or knows little, can this person know the essence of your speech from other things or other speech of your moving picture? If moving pictures of good essence become many this will be very good for new persons.
