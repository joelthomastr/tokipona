# <span class="en">The Way of Earth Writing Not of Euclid</span>

<span class="en">I say this: [A person can give all knowledge using Toki Pona]((https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/pana-sona-ale_en). But you can say this: "No person gives heavy knowledge using Toki Pona. If so, I cannot know this: Your knowledge is true or what?"</span>

<span class="en">When you say that I feel this: Your way is good. I say this: "This thing exists." You say this: "When I see the thing of your speech I can say this: This thing exists. But if I do not see I cannot say this." This is a way of a strong head.</span>

<span class="en">In this context, I made a moving picture of this name: The way of earth writing not of Euclid. This is very heavy knowledge from my perspective! But when you look at this moving picture you see this: A person can give heavy knowledge using Toki Pona.</span>

<span class="en">I want this: When you see my moving picture you are entertained. Good looking!</span>
