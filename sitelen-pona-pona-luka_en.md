# Sitelen Pona Pona Luka
{% include ante-pini_en.md date="2020-06-02" %}

[Sitelen Pona Pona](https://jackhumbert.github.io/sitelen-pona-pona/) is a writing that is a little different to [Sitelen Pona](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/hieroglyphs.php). But it is very good by me.

But I want to write using little power and using little time, because of this: I want to write all that is in my head using Toki Pona. I want to use Toki Pona each day.

## Sitelen Pona Pona Luka 1

I made this using this way: I looked at the heavy thing inside all the writing things. I used many groups of all the writings. After that I changed the writing for this:

 - I use one line for one writing
 - When I write using little time my hand does not feel bad
 - When I write using little time I do not say this: "What is this writing? I don't know."

## Sitelen Pona Pona Luka 2

After that I said this inside: A small number of writings are a little bad.

Because of that I changed a small number of writings.

Next to each writing I write a reason for change:
- Clearer: You can know this: What writing is this writing? You do not say this: This writing is like a different writing
- Easier: When I write it my hand feels good
- Aesthetics: Its looks are good by me

I want this: Next to my first writing this is good by you.

Under this I give a looking writing. You can look at all the writings in Sitelen Pona Pona and all the writings in Sitelen Pona Pona Luka at the same time:

It can be that I change my writing at a different time. But only when there is something important, I want to do this. It can be that you use my writing and you see something bad. If so, talk to me. On the [home](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/READMEen) page I give you the way to talk.

Be well!
