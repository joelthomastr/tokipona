## When a person uses Toki Pona this is good for them because of what?
Toki Pona is a new speak. What is a new speak? A new speak or a made speak is this: A person makes a new speak with their head. A person does not know a made speak from their parent.

Many new speaks are existing. But Toki Pona is not the same as other new speaks. This is because of what? In other, when a person uses Toki Pona this is good for them because of what?

In much time ago, Sonja talked about this in a [document](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/whytokipona.php): Why is Toki Pona good? In this document Sonja Lang talks about many good things of Toki Pona. One thing of many good things is this: When a person should use Toki Pona he should know this: What is in his talk? If a person does not know this he cannot talk with Toki Pona.

I feel this: The talk of Sonja is existing. In parent speak this talk does not exist. When a person uses parent speak possibly they do not know this: What knowledge is inside his talk?

: He comes to have the thing of his will. At that time another person knows this: What does he say inside? But possibly the user person of a parent speech does not know this: What knowledge is there inside his speech?

With parent speech why is this the situation? With a parent speech many names are there. With many things two names are there toward the same thing. But possibly the user person of parent speech does not know this. At one time he says something using one name. At a coming time he says the same thing using a different name. But he says this inside: "There are two names. This being so, two things are there." But one thing is there really.

Having many names is bad, because of what? This is bad because of many things. I give two things from these many things.

Thing one: A person cannot know these well: What is there really? In the past time, what was there? That which is there is there because of what? In coming time, a person must do what toward this: He feels good and comes to have a good situation? When a person does not know these he cannot do what is good toward himself or another person. This being so, he must know well the knowledge of his speech.

Thing two: When a person gives heavy knowledge he can use one name. He says this inside: All persons know this name. But possibly another person does not know. At the same time this other person says this inside: I know this name! But he does not know. After much coming time, something bad is there because of this. But no person knows this: This bad thing is there because of what? This is there because of this: Much time before, another person did not know well the name of the person's speech.

But with Toki Pona these two bad things are not there. This being so, using Toki Pona is good for a person.

But can you and I use Toki Pona for everything?

## Many people say this: A person cannot give knowledge of everything using Toki Pona

In Sonja Lang's [page](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/whytokipona.php) she says this: Heavy things like this are there: A person cannot give knowledge of it using Toki Pona. Robert Warnke [says like that](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jan-Lope/Toki_Pona_lessons_English/gh-pages/toki-pona-lessons_en/index.html#SECTION00210000000000000000).

Sonja Lang and Robert Warnke know Toki Pona well. At the side of them, I know little. But this speech is bad toward me. I do not want this: This is the situation.

This speech is not good by the underspeech of Toki Pona. What is underspeech? I use the name of underspeech toward this: When Sonja Lang made Toki Pona she had many inside speeches. These inside speeches gave her the way. When Sonja Lang made Toki Pona she did the will of these inside speeches. These speeches are like a table below a thing. The table keeps the thing high. Sonja Lang gave Toki Pona to the table of these inside speeches. These inside speeches keep Toki Pona high. This being so, I use this name for these inside speeches: Underspeech.

One speech of the underspeech of Toki Pona is this: Heavy knowledge is not heavy, it is only heavy looking. What really is heavy-looking knowledge? Heavy knowledge is a group of many things of small knowledge.

But Sonja Lang says this: A person cannot give heavy knowledge using Toki Pona. This being the situation, I feel this: Toki Pona is not good by its underspeech. But I say this: A person can give heavy knowledge using Toki Pona.

## Many people say this because of what?
Using Toki Pona can a person say a small item of knowledge? They can. Can they give a line from one small item of knowledge to a different small item of knowledge? They can. Can they make a group of much small knowledge using this way? They can.

This being so, a person can give heavy knowledge using Toki Pona. But many people say this: A person cannot. They say this because of what? What thing is there under this speech? Let us hunt for the thing under this.

Possibly they say this because of this:

When a person wants to speak using Toki Pona he has an inside speech of a parent speech. Possibly he hunts for one name or group of names of Toki Pona toward one name of a parent speech. In many groups of Toki Pona I see this: A person says like this to a knowledge person of Toki Pona: "When I want to say this using Toki Pona I must use which name?"

But with Toki Pona only one name is there for many names of a parent speech. When a person uses this name of Toki Pona another person cannot know this: This name is toward what thing?

Possibly this is the underthing of this speech: A person cannot give heavy knowledge using Toki Pona.

But I say a different speech. I say a different speech because of my knowledge of my doing. I do like all people for shopping, for eating, for housing, for other necessary things. My doing is speech change. The doing of speech change is this: I look at one page of one speech and I write the same knowledge toward a new page of a different speech.

My knowledge of speech change gives me this knowledge: When you want to change speech of a name you say this: What knowledge does this name give. But you cannot only say this. Separately you must say this: What knowledge does this name give in this page? Other speech at the side of one name gives this knowledge to you. You can know the knowledge of one name from its side speech.

With the new page in a different speech the same thing is there. You do not write one name. You write many names. These names are side speech toward other names in the page. When you write a name or name line you must stay and must not write in a little time and must look at the side speech. The side speech can change the knowledge of one name.

Using Toki Pona is good for you and me. You and I can give knowledge of everything using Toki Pona using this way. One name does not give much knowledge. But when at the side of much other speech another person can know this: This name of Toki Pona gives which knowledge?

## The way of giving knowledge of everything using Toki Pona
I say this: You and I can speak and can give knowledge of everything using Toki Pona. But you and I just use a good way toward this.

### - Look toward this only: The person looking comes to know what?

With a person of speech change he can use few names of many names or different names. This is not heavy.

The heavy thing is only this: When a person looks at a page of one speech they know or feel one thing. When a person looks at the page of a different language, he knows or feels the same thing, or what?

When you use Toki Pona, say only this inside.

### - Do not hunt for one name toward one name in your parent speech

Do not hunt for one name gropu toward a name of your parent speech. Hunt for a way of giving knowledge.

When you search for a name group in toki Pona toward a name of a parent speech, say this inside: This name group is a name toward what heavy thing? This heavy thing is a group of what small things?

In the coming time, give knowledge of one small thing. In the coming time, give knowledge of another small thing. When the small things are finished say this: These small things come to be at this heavy thing. Give a name toward this heavy thing. In the coming time you can use your new name toward this heavy thing.

### - Do not say this: Using many names is bad

When I say something using a parent speech I can use its name. But with Toki Pona I must give a new name group to it. Possibly a person looking only knows the official Toki Pona. I want to write toward a person like this. This being so, I must give knowledge of the new name group of my speech toward them.

The end of this is this: I write many names. When I use a parent speech I use few names. But with Toki Pona I must write many names. This is not crazy looking because of this: This is the way of Toki Pona.

Names of parent speeches number what? All parent speeches are different. But many persons of English use this amount of different names: Two hundred times a hundred names. This being so, one name in a parent speech can give much knowledge. This being so, you can give knowledge using few names.

But names of Toki Pona number what? This amount is this: A hundred and twenty five or a number by the side of this. This being so, one name of Toki Pona gives little knowledge. This being so, I must use many names toward giving knowledge. When I use one name of Toki Pona toward one name of a parent speech I cannot say this inside: Another person can know my speech. If I say this I am crazy!

Do not say this: When I use one speech in a parent speech I must use one speech in Toki Pona. This is not a possibility.

###  - Give much side speech

Say this inside: When a looking person knows only the official Toki Pona does he know my speech or not? If he does not know give knowledge to him of the name of your usage.

When you use a new name group say this: Can a looking person know the knowledge of this name group from side speech? Side speech is speech at the behind or the front of a name. At the behind or the front of this speech there is another speech that gives knowledge of this speech.

When a looking person cannot know, give knowledge of this to them: This name group gives what knowledge? When you do this the looking person says this: I really know this speech! In the coming time you can use this name group. The looking person knows it.

## End speech

Using this way I say this: You and I can give knowledge of everything using Toki Pona.

But you and I must use many names. You and I must give much side speech toward this: A looking person knows the speech of you and I.

But when this ends this is very good. This is good for all because of this:

- You and I know this knowledge well.

- Separately you and I can give knowledge well. A looking person knows well the speech of you and I.

Be well!
