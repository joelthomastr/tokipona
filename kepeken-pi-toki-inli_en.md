# "Why do you use English like a crazy person?"
> On 2020-05-31 I changed this page. I did not make changes after that.

My mother tongue is English. I know how to use it well. But on these pages I want to do something different. I want to give people a look at this: What happens when we use Toki Pona for everything?

I write everything on the pages here with Toki Pona. When that's finished I change the page into English. I don't want to make the English page too far from the same page in Toki Pona, because of this: Maybe people look at this page, but they don't know Toki Pona. I want to give them a look at this: What way is Toki Pona?
