# My Speeches on the Day of Toki Pona

In moon time number eight of this circling of the sun the community of Toki Pona did this: The Day of Toki Pona. This day was important because of this: On the same day of 20 circlings of the sun ago, Sonja Lang gave the first page of Toki Pona to all the world. So the community of Toki Pona said this: On the same day of this circling of the sun let us all do a recreational time. You can see [all of the moving pictures on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjOmpMyMxd8Ru7RzbKS0ZZ1E_S2J_pA2X).

Many persons did many things on the day of Toki Pona. They did entertaining battles and artistic sounds and recreational speech. With me, the day of Toki Pona was a good time for this: I give my knowledge of Toki Pona to all people. This is because of this: My way of Toki Pona is the way of knowledge. I have fun using knowledge.

On the day of Toki Pona I did two big speeches. You can listen to my two speeches in moving pictures on YouTube. But I feel a little bad because of this: All my speeches are in English. In coming time I want this: I give all this knowledge in Toki Pona. If I have time for this I will do this.

## Speech Number One: Toki Pona is a Looking Method of Speech Knowledge

In this speech I say this: Toki Pona is very entertaining, but Toki Pona is not only entertaining. Toki Pona is like a very powerful tool for this: Using Toki Pona a person can see the little information inside people's speech.

Knowledge persons see this: Ways of speech are many in all the world. All ways of speech are different and can make the head of a person crazy. Because of this, a small group of knowledge persons made a looking method. By this method of looking a person can see all the little information inside people's speech. But this looking method can be bad (complex) because of this: A person must write much speech. This looking method is not a way of speech. A person cannot speak using this looking method.

I say this: Toki Pona is very good because of this: Toki Pona is like the  looking method of the little group of knowledge people. Using Toki Pona a person can see all the little information inside people's speech. But at the same time a person speak using Toki Pona! A way of speech uses all the territories of the head of a person. So Toki Pona is a tool of much power.

## Speech Number Two: The Good Method of Speech Change

 {% include Jutu-suno-pi-toki-pona-2.md %}

In this speech I give knowlege of speech change. This knowledge is in the speech object of this page of mine of past time: [The method of giving big knowledge using Toki Pona](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/pana-sona-ale_LANGCODE#ijo4).

But in this speech I do not give only knowledge. At the same time I give a look. When you listen to my speech you come to know this: When a person uses this method this is looking like what? You can use the same method using which way?

I want this: When you look at thess moving pictures you come to know good knowledge or you are entertained.
