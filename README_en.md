Be well! This is my group of documents for this: I write something using Toki Pona. I want to become knowing Toki Pona, be playful, give entertainment and knowledge to all!

- I renewed this page: [A person can give all knowledge with Toki Pona](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/pana-sona-ale_si). Much time ago I made the first state of this page. But in the future time of that I saw this: brokenness is existing. Good to Gabriel Mizrahi. He gave knowledge to me. When I bettered my page I used his knowledge. I give the new state of this page to you.
- With me, this is the [Good Way of Toki Pona](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/nasin-pona-pi-toki-pona_en).
- I made [Sitelen Pona Pona Luka](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/sitelen-pona-pona-luka_en). Using it you can write Sitelen Pona Pona using a writing stick using little time. (Possibly this is true, I want this!)
- You can say this to me: ["You use English like a crazy person because of what?"](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/kepeken-pi-toki-inli_en)

Many other things are in my head, when I make them I give them to you in this group of documents.
