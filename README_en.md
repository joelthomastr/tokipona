Be well! This is my page for this: I write something using Toki Pona. I want to learn Toki Pona, have fun, give fun and knowledge to all!

- (New) To me, this is the [Good Way of Toki Pona](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/nasin-pona-pi-toki-pona_en).
- I say this: [You and I can give knowledge of everything using Toki Pona!](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/pana-sona-ale_si)
- I made [Sitelen Pona Pona Luka](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/sitelen-pona-pona-luka_en). Using it you can write Sitelen Pona Pona using a writing stick using little time. (Maybe this is true, I want this!)
- You can say this to me: ["Why do you use English like a crazy person?"](https://joelthomastr.github.io/tokipona/kepeken-pi-toki-inli_en)

Many other things are in my head, when they are finished I will give them to you.
